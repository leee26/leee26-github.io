My name is Esther Lee and I am a college freshman at Montclair State University. My major is Family Science and Human Development with Family Services Concentration. 
My dream career is to be a pediatric speech pathologist or ABA therapist.
I love to travel and try new things in new places, shop, hang out with friends, dance, and also enjoy my alone time once in a while.
I like to dance and have been dancing ever since I was 5. I'm continuing to pursue this hobby as a college freshman! 
Puzzles have become a big hobby over time. I didn't like it at first but now it gives me peace and takes my mind off of things.
I am working towards being a pediatric speech pathologist or ABA therapist. 
I would love to work with children and furthermore help children with disabilities grow into independent and strong adults that will impact the world in their own way without trouble. 
I wish that I can help them develop a voice that can be heard one day!

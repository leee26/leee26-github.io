<td>Hobbies: I like to dance and have been dancing ever since I was 5. I'm continuing to pursue this hobby as a college freshman! Puzzles have become a big hobby over time. I didn't like it at first but now it gives me peace and takes my mind off of things. </td>
<td>Future career: I am working towards being a pediatric speech pathologist or ABA therapist. I would love to work with children and furthermore help children with disabilities grow into independent and strong adults that will impact the world in their own way without trouble. I wish that I can help them develop a voice that can be heard one day!</td>
<td> Bucket List:
  <li>Travel the world</li>
  <li>Skydiving</li>
  <li>Go whalewatching</li>
  <li>Eat alone once in my life</li>
  <li>Make my own recipe</li> </td>
<tb>I was born and raised in Northern Jersey for all of my life, specifically Ridgefield and Palisades Park. It's a pretty close drive from campus which is pretty convenient. I like that my hometown allows me to indulge in my Korean culture, but at the same time, I would like to branch out and live in other places that are farther away from Jersey. </tb>
